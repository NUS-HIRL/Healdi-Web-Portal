This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Format files

Run the following command:
```
npm run pretty
```

NOTE: Ignore the babel errors, the formatter chokes near certain React components, but it doesn't break any formatting so it's fine
